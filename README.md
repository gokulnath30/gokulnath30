### 👀 What I’m interested in
- Generative AI & Large Language Models (LLaMA, GPT, Whisper)
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) & Vector Search
- Multimodal AI (Vision + Language + Audio)
- AI-driven product intelligence & anomaly detection
- Scalable ML systems and MLOps

---

### 🌱 What I’m currently working on
- Building and fine-tuning **LLMs using LoRA / QLoRA**
- Designing **RAG pipelines** with LangChain & FAISS
- Developing **AI-powered full-stack applications** (FastAPI, React)
- Productionizing ML workflows using **Docker, Kubernetes, MLflow, Azure ML**

---

### 💞️ Open to collaborating on
- GenAI & LLM research projects
- Applied AI for retail, speech, vision, and search
- End-to-end AI systems (from data → model → deployment)
- Open-source AI tools and developer platforms
